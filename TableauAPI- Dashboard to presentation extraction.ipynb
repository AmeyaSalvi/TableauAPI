However, in real life sceanario, there might be various Tableau server views with multiple filter combinations needed for creating a presesntation (something that I had to execute for my workspace). For that, please do write codes as multiple functions (functions for creating snapshots, tripmming image, and making presentations seperately) and create iterative code logics that would parse through multiple Tableau Views and filter combinations :)"
